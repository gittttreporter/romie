RetroArch as ROM library viewer:

Many people DO use RetroArch for browsing their collection
But many also find it clunky/overwhelming for just "browsing ROMs"
It's more focused on "launch and play" than "organize and admire collection"

The collection management gap:

Physical game collectors love tools like CLZ Games, GameEye, etc. for cataloging
ROM collectors don't really have a great equivalent
RetroArch's interface isn't designed for the "collector mindset"

ROMie could fill this by being:

Collection-first: Focus on browsing, organizing, discovering games you forgot you had
Metadata-rich: Show screenshots, descriptions, ratings, play history
Multi-device aware: "I have this on my Miyoo, Steam Deck, and phone"
Discovery-focused: "Games you haven't played," "hidden gems," filtering/sorting

The sweet spot might be:

Primary use: Sync ROMs to handhelds (your original goal)
Secondary use: Beautiful ROM collection browser that happens to also sync
Think "Plex for ROMs" rather than "RetroArch competitor"

RetroArch users might still use ROMie for the collection management aspect, even if they launch games through RetroArch. The two could complement each other rather than compete.
