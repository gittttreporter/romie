# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Romie!

## How You Can Help

**The best way to contribute right now is to use the app and report bugs or suggest features.** Detailed bug reports and feature requests help more than code contributions at this stage.

## Pull Requests

PRs are welcome, but please set expectations accordingly:

- This project is primarily maintained by one person (me) with limited time
- I may not be able to review or merge PRs quickly
- Some PRs may sit for a while or not get merged at all
- I'm focused on my own roadmap and vision for the project

That said, if you have a solid improvement or bug fix, feel free to open a PR. Just understand it might take time or may not align with where I'm taking the project.

## Opening Issues

Issues are the most helpful way to contribute:

- **Bug reports**: Steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, screenshots if relevant
- **Feature requests**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve, not just the solution
- **Questions**: Use Discussions or Discord rather than issues

## Questions or Discussion

Join the Discord for questions, feature ideas, or general chat: [link in README]
