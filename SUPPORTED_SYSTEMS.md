## Archive Files (ZIP/7Z)

ROMie supports compressed ROM files in `.zip` and `.7z` formats with automatic detection:

- **Import**: ROMie looks inside archives and processes single ROM files for system detection and RetroAchievements verification
- **Storage**: Archive files remain compressed in your library
- **Sync**: Compressed files are copied to your device as-is (not extracted)
- **Requirement**: Archives must contain exactly one supported ROM file

This saves storage space while maintaining compatibility with most emulators that can read compressed ROMs directly.

## Known Issues

**PlayStation (PSX)** is temporarily unsupported due to multi-disc game complexity. [Track progress →](https://github.com/JZimz/romie/issues/4)

**Nintendo DS** games work for syncing but cannot be verified for RetroAchievements progress. [Track progress →](https://github.com/JZimz/romie/issues/28)
