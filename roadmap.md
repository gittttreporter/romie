## ✅ V1 MVP (Must Have to Launch)

- [ ] Import single ROM files (e.g. `.gba`, `.sfc`, `.nes`)
- [ ] Automatically organize ROMs into `/roms/<console>/` folders
- [ ] Extract region from filename and store in metadata
- [ ] Clean display name for UI
- [ ] Store metadata to `roms.json`
- [ ] ROM list view in the UI with region tag
- [ ] Delete ROMs from the library
- [ ] Detect duplicate filenames and prevent overwrite

## 💭 Future Ideas

- [ ] Import `.zip` files (extract and scan contents)
- [ ] Multi-disc PS1 game support (`.bin`/`.cue` grouping)
- [ ] Box art scraping and caching
- [ ] Favorite/star ROMs
- [ ] Tag ROMs (e.g. "Fan Translation", "Repro", etc.)
- [ ] Auto-detect connected devices (e.g. Miyoo Mini+)
- [ ] One-click sync to SD card / device folder
- [ ] Settings panel (theme, sync preferences, storage path override)
- [ ] Backup and restore your library
